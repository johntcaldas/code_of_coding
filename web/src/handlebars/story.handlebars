            First Post! <br>
            I'm Typing right into the handlebars template for the entire "Story" section of the site. That means I'm
            procrastinating building out a back end to support "blogging".
            I've been doing enough wiring things together in the past couple of days to merit
            splashing a bit of content onto the site. Also, I'm a fan of continuous refactoring, and in writing this
                I'm signing myself up for some practice and learning.
            If I build a little bit at each step of the way, then I'll be "refactoring" as the site
            matures rather than trying to get the whole infrastucture wired together up front. The trick is to find
            that sweet spot where there is enough going on so that the refactor results in the immediate perception of
            benefit, but not quite so much as to make the refactoring a painfully time-intensive task. I do, after all,
            have this thing called a "day job" to which much of my time is devoted.<br><br>
